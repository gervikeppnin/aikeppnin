## Problems

Explore each challenge in detail:

- [**Reinforcement Learning Problem**](./RL_problem) - Optimize renewable energy distribution across Iceland's power grid
- [**Natural Language Processing Problem**](./NLP_problem) - Build an Icelandic language assistant for tourism
- [**Computer Vision Problem**](./CV_problem) - Detect and classify volcanic activity from satellite imagery

## How to Get a Server for Deployment

When submitting your solution, you are expected to host a server where your REST API will be deployed. As this competition is exclusively for students, you can sign up for **Azure for Students** to receive free credits for creating a virtual machine. Alternatively, you can deploy your submission locally (requires a public IP).

### Azure Setup Resources

The following links will help you create and configure your virtual machine:
- [Creating a Linux virtual machine](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/linux/quick-create-portal)
- [Install and configure xrdp to use Remote Desktop](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/linux/use-remote-desktop)
- [Create an inbound security rule](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-network/tutorial-filter-network-traffic) (ensures API endpoints are accessible for submission)

### Alternative Cloud Providers

You may also use:
- AWS Educate (free credits for students)
- Google Cloud Platform (student credits available)
- DigitalOcean Student Pack
- Your university's computing resources

**Important:** Set up your server early in the competition and test connectivity with the evaluation service as soon as possible. This helps identify and resolve any server-related issues well before the deadline!

## Submission

Submit your solutions through our automated evaluation system:

1. Package your solution as a Docker container
2. Push to our registry: `docker push registry.ai-championship.is/team-[YOUR_TEAM_ID]/[PROBLEM]:[VERSION]`
3. Submit via the portal: [ai-championship.is/submit](https://ai-championship.is/submit)
4. Your solution will be evaluated automatically

**Submission limits**: 
- Maximum 5 submissions per day per problem
- Final submission deadline: May 31, 2025, 23:59 GMT

## Scoring System

### Ranked Score (RS)
Your position relative to other teams:
```
RS = (N - R + 1) / N Ã— 100
```
Where N = total teams, R = your rank

### Total Score (TS)
Your combined performance across all problems:
```
TS = 0.35 Ã— RS_RL + 0.35 Ã— RS_NLP + 0.30 Ã— RS_CV
```

## Final Evaluation

After the competition closes:
1. **Code Review** (June 1-7): Top 10 teams submit full source code for verification
2. **Private Test Set** (June 8-14): Solutions evaluated on hidden test data
3. **Presentation Day** (June 20): Finalists present their approaches in ReykjavÃ­k
4. **Winners Announced** (June 20): Awards ceremony and networking event

## Prizes
