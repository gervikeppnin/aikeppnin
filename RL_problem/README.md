- Cost optimization
- Grid stability
- Response to demand spikes
- Renewable utilization rate

## Getting Started

Detailed problem specification and starter code coming soon.

## Submission Format

Your solution should include:
- Trained RL model
- Inference script
- Requirements.txt
- Documentation

Submit via Docker container to the competition platform.
