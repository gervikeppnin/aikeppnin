# Computer Vision Problem

## Challenge: Volcanic Activity Detection

Develop a computer vision system to detect and classify volcanic activity from satellite imagery, helping with early warning systems and scientific monitoring.

## Task Description

Your model should:
- Detect volcanic plumes and ash clouds
- Classify activity levels (dormant, minor, moderate, major)
- Track lava flows and thermal anomalies
- Identify changes over time
- Handle various weather conditions and image qualities

## Evaluation Metrics

- Detection accuracy (mAP)
- Classification F1 score
- False positive/negative rates
- Inference speed
- Temporal consistency

## Getting Started

Detailed problem specification and starter code coming soon.

## Submission Format

Your solution should include:
- Trained CV model
- Inference pipeline
- Requirements.txt
- Documentation

Submit via Docker container to the competition platform.
